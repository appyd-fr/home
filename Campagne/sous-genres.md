ACCIDENTAL TRAVEL
Ordinary people are somehow transported to a strange location, other planet, time, or
dimension with little understanding of how or why. A classic example is Mark Twain’s A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court; a more recent example is the TV series Lost.

VENTURE
The modern-era small town of Venture, caught in a temporal bubble of unknown origin, is physically transported across uncounted centuries into the future (or possibly into another dimension, or as some of the more religious and terrified believe, into some kind of weird afterlife).
The roads out of town end suddenly, giving way to a reddish landscape featuring miles-long filaments of “living” metal that grow and connect across the land and sky like a massive web. The world is apparently long-devoid of humans, though not of intelligent creatures (including inquisitors) that initially see Venture’s citizens as strange, new vermin to study.

ALIEN INVASION
A non-human species invades Earth using technology far in advance of what humans have. Usually, the intent is to take the world for themselves, make humans their slaves, eat everyone, or in some cases, do something so inexplicable that humans can’t really 
 understand it (yet may also eventually render the world uninhabitable to people, as in the novel Childhood’s End by Arthur C. Clarke). Sometimes aliens just want resources, as in the film Independence Day.
 
NEW YORK GREY
When the aliens known as greys first came to Earth, they did so secretly. They surreptitiously studied humans, sometimes abducting them to do advanced research.
Eventually, the greys learned everything they needed, and they emerged from the shadows in a historic event (known as the Revelation) in front of the United Nations
Headquarters in New York. The greys promised to partner with humanity, help them through their many troubles, and usher in a new golden age where grey and human worked side by side for a better tomorrow.
A few humans—and maybe even a few greys—still believe in the promises of the Revelation. However, the reality is that greys, on the whole, view most humans as useful servants or pets, not equals.
The Revelation has rendered humans into second-class citizens, no matter their merit
or pedigree. Greys have risen to positions of power and prominence, while most humans
have tumbled. Those who retain their status feel they do so only by the sufferance of the
greys, who often control major industries either directly or behind the scenes.
Many jokes revolve around the idea that greys are somehow sexually stimulated by humans, though most humans don’t really believe that. Jokes that most people find far less funny describe how greys have developed a secret taste for food made from
people.
Most greys operate in public and live like members of the 0.1%. But a few, known as
the Directorate, remain on the Mothership, which is sometimes visible hovering over
the city. The Directorate apparently sets grey policy for the species as a whole.

ALTERNATE HISTORY
“What if history had happened differently?” is the question posed—and answered—by
this subgenre. The point of divergence might be as recent as “What if Nazis had won World War II?” (as in the book and TV series The Man in the High Castle) to as long ago as “What if Rome had never fallen?” Another example is the New York Grey setting noted under Alien Invasion, especially if the Revelation happened several decades earlier.

NEW NIHON
In New Nihon, the economic and cultural prosperity enjoyed by the Land of the Rising Sun during the historical Edo period (1603 to 1868) never ended. The rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and Karou— essentially feudal governors and regional feudal lords, respectively—remains under the putative control of the Emperor, but the Shogun in Edo has the most day-to-day power.
Partly thanks to founder Ieyasu Tokugawa’s forward-thinking policies and philosophies (which were themselves developed from Confucian teachings), most people live comfortably and enjoy popular arts and culture that, in previous eras, were enjoyed only by the wealthy and powerful.
In fact, a technological revolution that never happened in the historical Edo-era Japan aided in a breakdown in the rigid and highly formalized social order, creating something
of a “middle class” among the merchant and peasant orders. Steam engines, the beginnings of electrification, the appearance of firearms in limited quantities, and several
time-saving machines, which would be anachronisms on Earth during the same
historical period, are normal in New Nihon.

APOCALYPTIC
Threats the end of civilization due to some kind of disaster. The focus might be on the disaster itself, or life after the disaster. The disaster could be anything destructive.
Many popular stories posit nuclear war, zombies, killer robots, or environmental collapse. If the sun is dying or time is winding down, dying earth is the subgenre name sometimes applied. When entropy itself is the enemy, different themes come to the fore. The series of Fallout computer games is a fantastic apocalyptic example.

THE EMPTY WORLD
In the Empty World, it’s like Seattle in December every day. Cloud cover is constant, grey, and oppressive. Coats and gloves only partly protect from a seeping damp chill that pervades everything. Power is out almost everywhere, and worst of all, there are no people. Streets are empty. Cars are parked as if their owners expected to return. Chalky dust covers everything that’s not exposed to the weather. Nothing moves in the parks but for the sway of empty swings in the wind. Silence lays as heavy as a shroud.
As anyone knows who lived through it, or as explorers who find the place soon learn, the vanished left suddenly and horribly. 
Something burned across space-time from another dimension, leaving a scar in reality itself. Humans fled to their basements and sublevels, attics and closets, and any other
place they could hide. It didn’t save them— at least, not most of them. Something killed
almost everyone, leaving behind millions of grave markers in the form of empty clothes
(and pet collars) filled with desiccated dust and ash.
Strange predators roam darkened buildings, including entities known as killing white lights.

CYBERPUNK
Is it a near-future setting where conglomerates supersede world governments to create a dystopian culture, and where self-empowerment is usually only possible by manipulating available technology to its limit and beyond? It might be cyberpunk. An early example of
cyberpunk likely includes Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, adapted from the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, though William Gibson’s novel
Neuromancer helped solidify the subgenre, as did Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash.

DYSTOPIAN
The opposite of utopian: a nightmare world, often due to political repression and police states, though possibly as a result of natural disaster or threat from some other subgenre. Freedoms for most people are limited. Normal morals take a back seat to the needs of the ruling power, however sadistic. Brave New World is a dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley. A more recent example is 84K by Claire North. 

ELEVENTH REICH
The conspiracy theorists were right about Nazis surviving, but their imagination didn’t come close to the real truth. The ideology of the Third Reich (Nazi Germany, 1933 to 1945) survived, but not because specific individuals were given safe haven by sympathetic organizations. No, it “survived” because this dystopian setting is also an alternate history setting, one in which Germany won World War II and went on to create an empire that rules most of the planet. (“Eleventh” because the previous Reichs were violently thrown down by even more vicious and cruel Nazi leaders in a series of coups.)
The Eleventh Reich is typified by rampant military glorification, mandatory military enlistment, extreme racism, scientific research unrestrained by ethics or morality, fascination with religious magic talismans, and extreme paranoia in an environment where anyone could be called out as an enemy of the state for any reason. In other
words, things responsible PCs would oppose. Out of fear, most of the populace goes along to get along, while high-ranking officials glory in their power, authority, and moral freefall by attempting to “ascend” to a state beyond death using all the scientific knowledge that the state can bring to bear. Order is maintained by a ubiquitous
patrols of Eleventh Reich soldiers, usually commanded by a storm marine.

FIRST CONTACT
The first meeting between humans and aliens. The films E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind are classic examples of the subgenre, but the concept is often applied more broadly to include advanced point-ofview characters meeting with the unknown, as happened in almost every episode of Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek.

ENDRURI INCURSION
An extra-solar intelligence known as the Endruri propagates across interstellar space as information encoded in flecks of nanomachine seeds. If conditions are right where they fall, they “sprout” by piggybacking on the native biology, installing Endruri intelligence in the adult version of a biological form otherwise apparently normal. These flecks aren’t randomly scattered, but rather specifically targeted at locations that interstellar analysis has shown might have planets capable of hosting life. Earth is just such a planet.
Over the course of a few years, a peaceful contact has developed between researchers and a handful of Endruri. However, before news of the peaceful first contact went live, an attack in the heart of a major city by what could only be an alien (in fact, an Endruri) war machine changed the equation. The original four Endruri on Earth— appearing in the form of a collie dog, an aspen grove, a bald eagle, and a human born in Senegal, Africa—sought to expand their knowledge of the universe by expanding their presence, but as with many different species, not everyone was of the same mind. A follow-up expansion
is seeding previously targeted worlds with nanomachine seeds that will grow into CRAZR-like beings coded to obey Endruri, with the premise of creating new Endruri homeworlds, at the expense of whatever might be in their way.

GENERATION SHIP
Unable to achieve FTL, a generation ship is a massive starship that takes so long to move between the stars that many generations might live and die onboard to serve as crew. The crew’s eventual descendants will one day serve as colonists at the hoped-for final destination. Because the ship would have to have a functioning, closed-loop environment with very little resource loss, not to mention robust methods for teaching each new generation how to crew a starship, or even care about what their ancestors set them up for, many potential pitfalls/story conflicts can emerge.
Many novels, shows, and films have treated this concept, including the stand-out novel
Dust by Elizabeth Bear.

HARD SCIENCE FICTION
Hard science fiction is distinguished from regular science fiction by the perception of scientific accuracy. Which means hard science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by mainstream scientific theory, including such mainstays as faster-than-light travel and time travel. 
Though similar social themes can play out in both, by some lights, hard science fiction
is opposite the space opera subgenre. A fantastic depiction of hard science fiction
can be found in The Expanse novels (and TV series) by James S. A. Corey, the pen name
used by writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck.

THE REVEL
Humanity has reached out into the solar system. Examples include supermassive O’Neill colonies, as well as colonies on the Moon, Mars, hollowed-out asteroids, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and floating cities hanging over the clouds of Venus. 
Even more amazing, colossal investments into a brand-new domain of physics recently produced a top-secret propulsion system, allowing humans to found nearby interstellar colonies.
Then, millions of miles of tunnels crisscrossing the Moon’s core beneath the regolith were discovered. Artificial tunnels. OLD tunnels. But the news never  reaches Earth. The discovery of the tunnels coincides with the Earth going completely  dark and quiet. No one in the solar system knows why . . .
The Revel is explored later in this book.
As with most complex s ettings, several other sci-fi subgenres weave in and out of the setting to give it texture and room for unexpected developments.

MILITARY SCIENCE FICTION
Interplanetary (or interstellar) conflict and war are the primary focus of military sci-fi settings. Those fighting the conflict are usually the characters. The more detail given to tactics with military spacecraft, power-armored ground troops, or war drones, the more “military” a given sci-fi setting. Examples include On Basilisk Station by David Weber (the Honor Harrington series debut), Armor by John Steakley, and All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. A recent example of military science fiction is The Red: First Light by Linda Nagata (The Red trilogy debut).

NEAR-FUTURE
Set on or near the Earth, near-future settings feature believable use of technology and science not far in advance of today, although usually with one or two pieces of breakout technology that promise to change things (or is already changing things).
Sometimes this is also called mundane science fiction. The novel After On by Rob
Reid is a great example, as is the novel Daemon by Daniel Suarez.

ROBOTS AND POSTHUMANS
Robots with human-like sentience, and/or humans who have transcended biology and exist as biomechanical entities far superior to modern humans is a popular underlying theme for many settings. Isaac Asimov explored the idea of sentient robots through his fiction, including I, Robot. A great example of posthumans in a far-future setting is found in Marrow by Robert Reed.

SCIENCE FANTASY
Arthur C. Clarke once said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and that’s the basis for most science fantasy settings. Monte Cook’s Numenera game setting is a great example.

SINGULARITY
Technological progress increases at an ever-accelerating rate, and with the aid of artificial intelligence, spikes beyond anything we can currently predict.
Because singularity settings predicate an incomprehensible outcome, almost anything 
 goes in the aftermath. Vernor Vinge’s Marooned in Realtime is a great example.

OMEGA NETWORK
A plane formed of pulsing green lines extends to the horizon, where blazes a city whose architecture features patterns of light folded in unthinkable complexity.
Constellations of data wheel overhead; each pinpoints a database. Entities in the Omega Network—from simple bots to free-willed encoded personalities and AIs—often resemble nodes of light trailing numerical glyphs. However, consensual spaces can radically alter how a given entity appears, as well as how the surrounding environment looks. When visible, an entity’s glyph tag provides a basic summary of their purpose, origin, and level. Entities, essentially free-willed data packets, have the run of the network. Just as in the time before all life was encoded into a machine, intrusion countermeasures electronics (ICE) keep some places off-limits to those curious about the truth of the network. Many
encoded personalities can’t seem to recall what happened to the Earth, no matter how
hard they try to remember, or where they attempt to look.

SLIPSTREAM
Usually, some element of the world that is otherwise mainstream for its time is tweaked in a speculative fashion, such as in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale.

SOCIAL/SOFT SCIENCE FICTION
Future societies are extrapolated, and sociological psychological themes predominate. How a future society reacts to a particular threat or opportunity is what social science fiction usually explores. A great example of social science fiction is C.J. Cherryh’s Foreigner series of novels.

SPACE EXPLORATION
Exploration of space is such a well-worn subgenre that it’s almost implicit to the larger genre.

SPACE OPERA
Most technological elements of hard science fiction and many of the known laws of physics are dispensed with in space opera. Common fantastic tech in space opera is faster-than-light (FTL) travel, but also includes spacecraft that deploy gravity generators, the capability to make 90-degree turns, or the ability to come up to speed or stop without long periods of acceleration or deceleration. Other elements include empires (or at least a series of interstellar states) spanning several star-systems or even the entire galaxy, a common language among disparate aliens (or at least perfect translation among them), and classic sci-fi tropes like laser pistols, humanoid robots, and the ubiquitous flying car.

THE GRAND IMPERIUM
More than a hundred years ago, the Grand Imperium took power and overthrew the Galactic Council, putting the entire galaxy under the thumb of the Empress. The current Empress, Tahali V, has sat upon the throne for nine years and is as ruthless and terrible as all those who came before her. Each Empress of the royal line is so similar, in fact, that some believe them to be a succession of clones rather than natural offspring. But this is not the official story related in historical educational broadcasts.
The worlds of the Imperium are connected thanks to starships with hyperspace drives. This technology allows travel from any planet in the galaxy to another in just a few days or weeks. Most planets have at least one busy starport, all of which engage in interplanetary trade and bring hundreds of intelligent races together.
The Imperium attempts to control travel and trade, but smugglers and unlicensed
ships slip through their fingers on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the Imperium starfleet
is feared throughout the galaxy.

STEAMPUNK
Steampunk aesthetics usually focus on 19th-century Victorian England, where steam power is widely used, as well as bits of technology far in advance of the time, such as power armor, robots, lasers, and so on. The “antique” form factor of this technology matches the overall aesthetic. 
Boneshaker is a steampunk novel by Cherie Priest, though it weaves in several other
genres and subgenres.

TIME/DIMENSION TRAVEL
Characters move backward or forward to different points in time, or into parallel realities or universes. The TV show Travelers demonstrates time travel, while the novel The Number of the Beast by Robert A. Heinlein demonstrates travel into other dimensions. The long-running Doctor Who show often demonstrated both (as well as every other subgenre, eventually).

ZED AMERICA
In this alternate dimension (which is also an apocalyptic dystopia), most of America
has returned to nature—and once-human hordes of zombies shamble through the
smoldering corpses of cities and stagger down wreck-strewn roads. High-security
fortress enclaves and lonely keeps are scattered points of light in the surrounding
zombie darkness. Within these safe zones, the “American way of life” continues, one
that includes daily blood screening to detect the virus that causes the transformation,
walls bristling with automated guns and drones, and lives separated by miles and
miles of zombie-infested highways in poor repair.
The status quo between survivors and zombies is fragile, because every year, new
zombie virus replication events convert fresh victims, sometimes even those who
hunker behind high fortress walls.

UPLIFT
Through genetic engineering, upgrading an entire species of creatures to sapience and self-cognizance. A fantastic example is Startide Rising by David Brin, though 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick’s concurrent film first popularized the concept. The various Planet of the Apes movies reveal an apocalyptic downside to uplifting other hominids that come to see humans as their oppressors.

UTOPIAN
An ideal world. Often, conflict comes when the ideal world is threatened, or is shown not to be as ideal as advertised. The film Logan’s Run is example of the latter (because to some who learn the truth, it’s actually a dystopia).

SUMMERLAND
A luxurious high-tech city exists beneath a climate-controlled dome on a world supposedly ruined by overpopulation. Under the dome, citizens live an idyllic life,
with all their needs cared for, and all their desires met—so long as those desires do
not stray into restricted regions. All control and power flow from an enigmatic AI called
the Law, who oversees everything and everyone in Summerland. Most people live
long, satisfied, if not especially productive lives. Truthbots visit those who try to leave
Summerland, ask too many questions about the ruined world above, or otherwise cause
trouble. These metallic servitors are well versed in brainwashing techniques, however
damaged a “client” becomes in service to learning the “truth.”
Citizens exist within well-defined castes that determine status, rations, access to entertainment, and other benefits. In fact, there is little difference in which caste gets
what benefit, but the Law enforces it as a method to keep one group of Summerland’s
citizens artificially concerned about another group, rather than turning their attention on
the true controller behind the scenes. 
The Law is not completely electronic, though it is mediated by a computer interface. In fact, the Law is an increasingly schizophrenic mind made up of seven founding citizens whose brains are frozen in liquid nitrogen and linked via a computer-assisted network to drones, surveillance cameras, and the many complex systems that keep the dome a
functioning artificial environment.

VIRTUAL REALITY
A simulation rendered so well that it seems real. Novels, TV shows, films, and games have used this concept extensively. The film, The Matrix explores the idea, as does The Strange game setting by Bruce R. Cordell and Monte Cook, by predicating a dark energy network in which limitless worlds reside.

ECHO OF LIGHT
In a twist, virtual reality characters become sentient, but realize that they reside in a world apart from the real one. Some seek to manifest themselves in the real world by building bodies of actual matter. Doing so requires first some control over a poorly-monitored manufacturing area outside the simulation, one that they can modify and refine so that when the time comes, they can walk forth as manifest creatures that look almost human. These v-people just want to integrate into human society, or at least partner with them.
However, not every entity found in the many virtual-scapes hosted by servers the world over is so benign. Other v-creatures realize the potential for power they have, given that they can spawn instances of themselves in real matter, possibly installing themselves in military machines and in newly fashioned bodies of their own advanced design.
In the Echo of Light world, v-entities come into the real world, and real people dive into
the virtual, offering amazing opportunities, but also unexpected dangers and the threat
of war.
