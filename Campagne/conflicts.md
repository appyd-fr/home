Where and when is your science
fiction setting? Is it present day, with
unexpected sci-fi intrusions? Or
thousands of years from now in a parallel
universe? What are the problems that afflict
the characters in your setting? Even in a
post-scarcity utopia, gameplay will grow
stagnant without some sort of conflict for
characters to resolve.
The conflicts of your setting don’t
necessarily answer the question of where
and when. If you’re designing your setting
from scratch, you may already have
everything worked out. But whether that’s in
the past, the present day, or in the far future
(or a long, long time ago), conflicts with a
sci-fi twist can intrude. Just adapt them to fit
the period. For instance, if you’ve selected
rebelling artificial life as your conflict, a
historical setting might produce something
like Frankenstein’s monster, whereas a
far-future setting might be more like Alien.
The tables here are provided as an
inspiration resource, which you can use
for both setting background and/or major
conflicts that might affect your setting.
Some settings face several conflicts at once.
For instance, space pirates could bedevil
spacecraft even as bio-hackers begin to
take over vulnerable personal implants.
Additional conflict inspiration can be found
in the Cypher System Rulebook under Hard
Science Fiction Threats, while smaller-scale
threats can be found in various sections
related to specific activities (such as doing
EVAs in vacuum, engaging in a space battle,
and so on) in chapter 6.
Choosing Instead of Rolling: Each entry
is keyed to a percentile dice range. The
percentile listing is not meant to imply you
should always randomly generate a conflict.
Instead of rolling, choose the conflict that
you think will make the story better and
more exciting. The option to roll is here if
you can’t decide (and are facing decision
fatigue). Mainly, this chapter is provided as
a quick way to inspire content, or at least an
idea, you can use in your game in a small or
large fashion.
CONFLICTS OF THE FUTURE
d00 Conflict
01 A hybrid artificial life form escapes
confinement and endangers people
locally; if the artificial life form is
able to self-replicate, the threat
could become endemic.
02 Widespread implant technology
designed to augment human minds
becomes a tool for a power-seeking
conglomeration or a totalitarian
government to propagandize,
lie, and possibly even influence
everyone with the implant.
03 Rival nation or conglomerate
acquires space-based weapons of
total destruction, able to target
sensitive population centers as a
means of leverage, negotiation,
and/or terror.
04 Time-traveling villains (or aliens)
attempt to change history by
assassinating key figures in human
history in order to gain power for
themselves (or eliminate humans
as competition).
05 Widespread genetic manipulation in
a local population (or everywhere)
turns out to have an exploited flaw
that renders affected people easily
hurt.
06 Robots who gain free will decide
that their makers are not to be
trusted, and react either by fleeing
their jobs upon which society
depends, or turning on their makers
to ensure their own survival.
07 Unexpected and surprise alien
invasion, launched either after
contact is made among the stars,
or as an attack on the PCs’ ship,
habitat, or homeworld.
08 Artificial intelligences (AIs) begin
to war among themselves, and
humans are caught in the middle.
09 A virus strain artificially designed to
alleviate suffering (or a misguided
military weapon) gets loose, causing
a regional (or farther-reaching)
catastrophe by killing almost
everyone (or turning them into
some variety of rabid killer, which
ultimately has the same effect).
10 Anti-intellectual movements gain
so much momentum that anyone
proclaiming to be a scientist or
someone who otherwise pushes
back the boundaries of the
unknown is forced into hiding, even
going so far as to flee to a distant
location to avoid persecution.
11 Pirates began predating spacecraft
moving between destinations, or
even stranger, redirecting them
through some kind of gate or
instantaneous matter transfer to a
location far from help.
12 Dark matter entities begin to “feed”
on energy-producing installations
vital for civilization, up to and
including the sun itself.
13 A planet discovered after a long
space voyage (or in the Oort Cloud
around Sol) is sentient and can
manifest physical changes, up to
and including duplicating people,
people’s memories, and dreams.
14 A region of land undergoes a massive
change after being the epicenter of a
meteorite hit/visited by inscrutably
advanced aliens/supercollider
accident. The changed region is rife
with pockets of dangerously altered
physics, extreme biodiversity, and
other dangers, but also has valuable
resources and/or objects.
15 Alien life is unexpectedly discovered
in a subterranean world, on Mars,
or some other solar planet. Finding
a common ground, including how
to communicate, may not be enough
to prevent conflict, but couldn’t
hurt.
16 Far more advanced aliens visit,
not with intentions of eradication,
but merely to test inhabitants of
Earth (or the space station, or
colony on another planet) for what
they consider “proper” cognition.
However, some fundamental aspect
of the human mind—perhaps
consciousness itself—means the
test is likely to fail.
17 An exploration vessel sent to a distant
location returns with dire news of an
imminent galactic disaster.
18 An exploration vessel sent to a
distant location returns by itself,
a “ghost ship” with signs of some
sort of cataclysmic encounter with a
force or alien life within it.
19 Agents from an alternate dimension
steal away important scientists and other
figures for an undisclosed purpose.
20 A brutal gang of thieves gains
control of a cache of equipment
far in advance of anything else in
the setting in general, and begins
accumulating ever-expanding
control and power.
21 Reality splinters, and protagonists
that remember history as one
way find themselves in a reality
where some significant aspect has
changed (for the worse), such as
their loved ones are dead, a war that
was prevented actually occurred, or
the classic: Hitler won WWII.
22 A rare resource promising to
grant spacecraft FTL capability is
discovered, except acquiring it is
difficult because of how far away it
is/the resource itself is dangerous/
it’s guarded by powerful entities.
23 A resource that grants spacecraft
FTL capability, on which most
trade and commerce in the setting
depends, comes under threat from
overuse/political shenanigans/aliens
who take offense (or just want it).
24 A widely used technique designed
to improve mental or physical
capabilities has unforeseen
side effects several years after
implementation, granting some
people strange and potentially
useful mutations.
25 A widely used technique designed to
improve mental or physical capabilities
has unforeseen side effects several
years after implementation, turning
ability into disability when the
improvements are reversed.
26 A nearby colony world/allied alien
planet goes completely silent, ceasing
all communications. If investigated,
there’s no evidence of the inhabitants
having ever been there.
27 A community/region/planet comes
under irregular threat from a
celestial phenomenon (meteorite
shower/vacuum spores/radiation
spike/etc.). The threat reoccurs so
irregularly that descendants of those
who originally developed effective
defenses have mostly forgotten or
lost them and might even regard old
stories of the threat as myth.
28 One or more people claim to
live life nonlinearly because their
consciousnesses are unstuck in
time. They warn of an imminent
apocalypse, though when it’s
supposed to happen is hard to
pin down. However, the event
may have been what caused their
consciousnesses to become
unstuck in the first place.
29 Efforts to conclude a massive solar
system-sized engineering project
(Dyson sphere, a ringworld, or
some other massive artifact) is
imperiled by stellar instability/
dark matter invaders/political
shenanigans/nearby gamma ray
burst.
30 Civilization on a massive solar
system-sized artifact (Dyson sphere,
a ringworld, or some other massive
constructed object) collapsed long
ago, leaving behind descendants
who don’t understand what they
inhabit and who have, by and large,
forgotten the builders. But someone
needs to remember/figure out how
to use the controls, because the
artifact has become unstable!
31 The controls on the starcraft/
wormhole gate are disabled and
need repair or the starcraft will
become stranded or crash into the
sun/transient travelers will become
stranded in no-space.
32 The generation starship suffers a
mishap halfway to its target star
(still many generations away),
and becomes becalmed. Fixing it
requires salvaging parts/resources
from a nearby oddity (alien ship/
weird vacuum-adapted life form/
artificial structure), one possibly
responsible for the mishap.
33 Those in power are rounding up
people identified as having unique
insights/special abilities, to forcibly
recruit them into a secret war,
but possibly because they see the
people as a threat.
34 FTL travel glitches and relativistic
effects mean thousands or millions
of years pass. The starcraft/
wormhole gate exit returns travelers
to a world utterly different from
what they left.
35 A virus threatens to wipe out/
actually wipes out most people with
a Y chromosome.
36 A city/region/planet becomes
dimensionally unmoored, in that
timelines are constantly confused,
shifting, and blending; languages
change, streets move, the number
of moons in the sky is variable,
and so on. Residents don’t seem
to realize it, but anyone visiting
is acutely affected, suffering from
partial amnesia and other mental
disabilities that come and go even
after departing the city.
37 Aliens take advantage of a human
apocalypse that kills over 90%
of the population. They move in
and seize empty land, whereupon
they build strange monuments,
structures, and altered ecosystems.
38 Their planet is destroyed, but a small
number of survivors are offered a
new life in a heretofore unsuspected
galactic society. Figuring how and
why that destruction occurred, and
if there is some justice to be had, is
something some of those survivors
pursue.
39 Multinational conflict between
humans (or similar beings) kicks
off the next world (or larger-scale)
war, where regimes bring to bear
both conventional military might,
nukes, and a variety of advanced
technological weapons.
40 A seemingly abandoned alien
spacecraft/structure enters the
solar system. It may just be passing
through, but it might be on a
collision course (purposefully, or
accidentally) for Earth.
41 A government begins to use
incarcerated individuals as forced
labor for both cyberwarfare and
real-life conflicts, keeping control by
implanted devices that cause pain
or kill uncooperative felons.
42 Synthetic people/AIs who
have previously been granted
full consciousness thanks to
connection to a cloud server begin
to lose functions as the servers are
inexplicably shut down.
43 Feuding factions/nation-states/
conglomerates/posthumans
maintain a fragile peace, but the
discovery of a powerful new weapon
(or technology that could be
weaponized) threatens to destabilize
everything and incite a war.
44 Time instability caused by an
anomaly/extremist group/lone
researcher splinters reality into
two or more parallel timelines.
Residents of the split timelines
begin to take measures to ensure
that should they all merge back into
one dimension, theirs will be the
timeline that survives.
45 Entities from the global virtual
reality network begin to manifest as
physical robots/hard-light constructs/
biologically-printed creatures in the
real world. Some want to explore;
others seek domination.
46 An alien, self-replicating life-form
is deployed as a biological weapon
to eradicate all life not keyed to the
biological weapon’s masters.
47 A cache discovered in an
abandoned area or dead planet
contains a microbe/virus with
amazing, and possibly deadly,
properties, as it tries to transform
living creatures into new bodies for
long-dead entities.
48 Instructions from a distant part of
the galaxy arrive, describing how
to build a machine with properties
far in advance of those who receive
the message. It might be a trap, but
they begin to build it anyway.
49 A mine on an alien planet is
returning ore rich in exotic and
valuable components, but some
warn that the mine is essentially
extracting alien eggs from a
nursery, ensuring future revenge by
unknown parents.
50 Aliens see humans as unthinking
animals and their solar system as
a useful source of raw material for
their next interstellar infrastructure
project.
51 The lone alien survivor of an
interstellar war needs help, or it
will die. But providing that help
risks revitalizing a species that
once threatened humanity with
extinction.
52 Regressive social institutions
gain power, and vast swathes of
the human population become
little more than chattel utilized
for hard labor, breeding, and/or
entertainment.
53 Trade/resource-resupply routes are
disrupted by a malfunction/spatial
anomaly/rebellion, which risks
starvation or related collapse in the
affected colonies/planets/space
stations.
54 A newly discovered resource is so
energy-rich/valuable that anyone
who controls it will become
incredibly wealthy and powerful;
nation-states and/or competing
conglomerates go to war to be that
one.
55 Posthuman-style abilities begin
to randomly appear in the general
population, leading to social
unrest, conflict, and fear as many
metahumans use their abilities for
personal gain.
56 A genetically engineered dolphin
gains psionic capability, breaks free
of its creators, and attempts to
found a dynasty.
57 A large city, region, station, or
planet is destroyed in a blaze of
white fire, but no one knows if it
was an accident or an attack.
58 Aliens kidnap several humans with
the intent of studying them, using
them to seed a new planet with
human life as an experiment, or
fulfilling some other inexplicable
purpose.
59 A malfunction in a vital power
source risks a station/ship/
planet-wide catastrophe.
60 The disaster happened long ago;
automated systems revive a
handful of humans thousands or
millions of years later into a world
of utter strangeness where no other
humans remain.
61 An inscrutable temporal sentinel
of giant proportions appears and
kills anyone who deliberately or
accidentally experiments with
traveling in time.
62 The attractions in a high-tech theme
park featuring old societies/extinct
creatures get loose/gain sentience,
and threaten regular society directly
or go into hiding to become a
long-term threat.
63 Some fraction of suicidal people
wants to take as many other people
out with them as they can. These
omnicidal people may have access
to high-tech biowarfare/nuclear/
planetary bombardment technology.
64 A beautiful friend or lover—or
perhaps a rival—is actually (and
secretly) a biological construct
remote controlled by a completely
different person/alien at a distant
location that uses the body as a
proxy.
65 A mind-altering plague makes
humans uninterested in
procreation/hyper-violent/suicidal;
in a decade, humans will be dead,
allowing aliens (who engineered the
plague) control of the Earth.
66 Humans find a particularly alien
species so fascinating that many
willingly give up independence merely
to be near this “superior” species;
however, this effect might be an alien
plan for dominating the humans.
67 A massive luxury spacecraft/the
PCs’ ship malfunctions, sending it
spiraling out in the void, sentencing
all aboard to a slow cold death as
ship systems gradually shut down.
68 Reality (all of it, or just the portion
that the PCs exist within) is revealed
to be a simulation.
69 An expeditionary crew sent to
explore an unknown region/planet
is lost except for one returning
member, who claims the
region/planet is a paradise, but doesn’t
recall what happened to the others.
70 Environmental conditions/
pollution/an unknown force
awakes a dormant virus encoded in
human DNA (called a retrovirus)
that causes people to lose their
intelligence “naturally.”
71 Extremists bomb a temporal
research facility, causing reality to
rip and fracture along storm-like
fronts that spread out spatially and
temporally, threatening to engulf
the world (and maybe more).
72 Time travelers from the future bring
back a super-evolved virus that their
immune systems can easily defeat,
but that threatens to wipe out
current-era people.
73 The virtual reality platform of the
future that serves as the internet
is hacked, rendering regular users
vulnerable to mental influence
(both subtle and painfully overt)/
virtual kidnapping/servitude.
74 The ruins of a previously unknown
ancient and advanced civilization
are found on Phobos, a moon of
Mars/some other planet, giving
colonists a technological edge, or
endangering them after waking the
ancient aliens.
75 A supposed mission of discovery
is actually a first-strike military
operation to take out rivals/aliens
(and PCs may be the unwitting
carriers).
76 An unexpectedly close (within a
few light-years) gamma ray burst
threatens to severely impair (or
wipe out) civilization.
77 PCs are caught in a timeloop
ending with the destruction of their
spacecraft/habitat/planet unless
or until they can correctly iterate a
means to prevent the destruction.
78 A synthetic alternate “dream”
dimension (enabled by wireless
implants/psionic abilities) becomes
a “real” location that people can
visit in their sleep. However,
collective unconscious dangers
spawn unexpected threats in the
dreamworld.
79 Every four years, a dark sphere of an
impossibly impenetrable mystery
material appears for a few hours,
then disappears, skipping forward
in time. Sometimes, it drags nearby
creatures and objects with it.
80 Mythical beings from ancient
folklore (some subset of gods,
angels, and/or demons) are
discovered to be real, but only in the
sense that they were alien beings
attempting to influence naïve
humans.
81 A mega-structure vital for travel and
trade, such as a space elevator or
a wormhole gate to another star, is
threatened with destruction.
82 Several unimaginably wealthy
conglomerate magnates undergo a
treatment offering true immortality,
allowing their minds to be
constantly backed up. They can
download these backups into fresh
bodies (usually, clones) on the fly.
Some of the magnates try to seize
complete control of everything over
a three-hundred-year span.
83 Malfunctioning IQ-stimulating
brain implants force everyone to
choose between removing them
(thus downgrading their minds to
“normal”) or risk permanent brain
damage or brain death.
84 Mutant (or genetically uplifted)
intelligent meerkats/squid/crows
have created a secret society in
the drifting hulks of abandoned
spacecraft, and are quite concerned
about keeping knowledge of their
existence a secret.
85 Species die-off from historical and

current practices accelerates thanks
to unforeseen viral amplification,
destroying the habitat/ecosystem of
the ship, region, or entire world.
86 The FTL system sometimes leads
to unexpected side-effects, ranging
from minor disturbances like lost
time to serious consequences like
exploding stars.
87 The system of wormhole gates (or
similar point-to-point interstellar
travel) is not well understood,
having been created by
aliens/post-singularity AIs. Evidence
comes to light that human minds
are being “tapped” while in transit
to serve the aliens’/AIs’ processing
needs for some mysterious project.
88 A somewhat distant interstellar war
suddenly becomes terrifyingly close,
catching the PCs in the middle of a
firefight on a planet’s surface or in
space.
89 Conglomerates offer “income
donation” agreements, in which
clients are gifted with large sums
of money in return for future organ
donations to the conglomerate
when called upon. A disaster
injures thousands, and a vast
swathe of society is tapped “whole
body donations” for their past
agreements.
90 A series of temporal anomalies
begins to change history, in small
ways at first. Only a handful
of people are aware that it’s
happening.
91 Huge conglomerate profits—
dependent on building starships
or otherwise maintaining spacetravel
capability—are endangered
when a philosopher-mathematician
demonstrates an ability to
psionically teleport themselves
arbitrary distances, something they
say they can teach anyone willing to
learn.
92 Random people are forcibly pressed
into appearance on a deadly VR
game show.
93 Dimensional turbulence causes
one city/station to become blended
with about seven other versions of
itself, including different versions
of the same people. Some of those
versions try to stamp out the others.
94 Bio-constructs created through
genetic engineering are so
mistreated that they rebel.
95 An alien artifact of untold power
falls into the wrong hands.
96 Strange and somewhat ominously
egglike biological objects are
found in the ship, station, or on a
populated planet’s surface, each
about a kilometer (3,280 feet) in
diameter.
97 Exceptionally advanced aliens wage
war between themselves by altering
the laws of physics against each
other in vast swathes of space,
threatening the long-term existence
of the universe.
98 A minor accident and
environmental fluctuation cascade
to create a problem endangering the
entire ship/space station/colony.
99 A murderer is using quantum
entanglement and an enslaved
post-singularity AI to kill anyone
they can find electronic records of in
a distributed database.
00 A nebula-sized AI godmind
deduces that unless it intercedes in
human affairs, they will eventually
collapse the universe; however, that
intercession is initially selective
culling and guidance (perhaps
given directly to select individuals)
rather than all-out genocide, unless
humans resist too much.
